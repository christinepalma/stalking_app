<h1>USER STORIES</h1>

As a stalker, when I go to the website, I want to be able to easily see a user's public social media feeds on one page.

As a psycho-ex, I want to be able stalk my former significant other, just in case they've either started dating again or are publicly posting negative things about our dysfunctional relationship.

As social media blogger and tweeter, I'd like to be able to see all of my social media on one page so that I can monitor what the public sees, perform general quality control and for continuity.

As an hr director or recruiter, I want to be able to screen applicants by going to their social media pages and seeing what they post.
